# Editor Full Screen

Ideal for presentations or to have a better perspective to work

Full screen mode: only the file content is shown. by default the status bar is hidden (see settings)

Zen Mode: the navigation bar is still visible. quite like in VSC 

It fits to the window content. So you can split, resize your OS window it will fit in
