# Editor Full Screen

Ideal for presentations

Full screen mode: only the file content is shown (hotkey suggestion: ctrl+alt+f)
Zen mode: the navigation bar still appears (hotkey suggestion: alt+f)

limitations: the context menu can't be used. If you split or reduce a window in you OS, it will go full screen anyway, not the window size.
