# Editor Full Screen

New: no restart anymore. Reveal bar on hover.   
I recommand to use easy toggle sidebars with it. This is the perfect complement

Ideal for presentations or to have a better perspective to work

Full screen mode: only the file content is shown. by default the status bar is hidden (see settings) (hotkey suggestion ctrl+alt+f)

Zen Mode: the navigation bar is still visible. (hotkey suggestion alt+f) 

To show the ribbon go to the left edge
To show headers go to the top edge

It fits to the window content. So you can split, resize your OS window it will fit in
